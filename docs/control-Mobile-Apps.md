## Apple and Google banning tempated apps

Some time ago Apple started banning templated apps. This caused us being unable to offer iOS apps anymore. Recently Google announced to start banning templated apps from their Play Store also. This might mean that your app will get removed from the Play store or a new app might get rejected.

### What are templated apps?

Templated apps are apps that share mostly the same codebase but are modified in for example looks or in minor ways. These include our apps, as well as apps from some of our collegues. This is also the case for app code bases you can buy to modify. Apple and Google plan to find these (which is easy as they share the same code) and delete them. 

### Can you make a non-tempated app?

That is almost impossible unless we set toghether with every client and design their app from scratch. We would be unable to offer apps at a competitive price this way. SHOUTca.st is also not a mobile app consultancy firm and has no plans to offer on demand app development work. We will still do our best to offer our apps to our customers

### What is the long term plan?

Our current plan is to make a radio directory app which is ad free and free to use with the option for the SHOUTca.st clients to customize the app's look when their station is playing, as well as integrate social media, messaging, etc.

## Requesting your apps

In Control, click on *Manage* in the navigation bar.

Still in the navigation bar, select the service for which you wish to request apps by clicking on the service switcher.

In the sidebar, click on *Mobile Apps*.
![](https://images.shoutca.st/0cX3iclpSWmVB5lyrL6b_gD7sSAy.png)
Click on *Submit a request* to submit an app request for your service.
![](https://images.shoutca.st/KtcoURmUSji9AZoT4qhh_DwDg1U2.png)
Fill in the form properly without ignoring the guidelines and tips, then submit the form. Control will then reload to confirm your submission.

You will be notified whenever your app is submitted and if there are any issues with your request.
> **ETAs**
> The estimated wait times indicated in Control are what they are: *estimated*. That means that they don't always correspond to the current average wait time. This is especially true when we have an issue with our build system or developer account, or more generally, when there is a high demand for mobile apps.

> **IMPORTANT**
> Opening tickets to ask when your app will be available is a waste of time, as we will **not** reply to such tickets.\n\n* In case you're worried about your app request not having been received on our end, don't worry. If Control said your app request was submitted, then we received it.\n\n* Are you impatient? Unfortunately, you'll have to wait for at least one week before getting your iOS app. This is because of the always high demand for mobile apps and the Apple approval process (which already takes a full week). Thus, opening a ticket to ask us \"when will I get my app\" will **not** help at all.\n\n* Want to follow your app request status? You can do this in Control.


## Editing your app request

You can also edit your app request from Control at any time.

On the *Mobile Apps* page, there is a link to view more info about your request. When you click on it, your app request will be shown with all details, and you'll be offered the choice of editing it.

App updates are not always processed as fast as initial requests are, especially when we have a high demand for apps. Again, we kindly ask you not to open any tickets for this, as they're a waste of time for both you and us.

## About Android apps

On 2016-03-24, Google suspended our account. We're working on recovering the account. Unfortunately, Google is known not to reinstate accounts often or easily.

If you already had an Android app but can't find it anymore, this is because Google has taken down all of our apps.

In the meantime, we offer 2 options to get your app back in the Google Play Store.

The first is the option to self-host your app (under your own Google Play Developer account). There is an option for this in Control where you can request and download your APK. See [Self-Host your Android apps](#self-host-your-android-apps) for more details.

The second option is to get your app on our new Play Store account. Since Google limits new apps per day, this is ***much*** slower as there will be a waiting list. This will take as long as it needs to.

Therefore, **we strongly recommend self-hosting your app**, as that is more flexible for you, you get access to statistics and your account is independent from all other apps.

In both cases, you have to go to the app request details page in [Control](https://control.shoutca.st), edit and save it so we can process your app request again. You'll be notified when your app is resubmitted or when it is available for download.

> **"title": "Submissions to the Play Store are currently suspended"**
> Google has suspended two apps for an invalid reason again. As they have a three-strike policy, we're appealing to avoid having our account terminated again. Submission of Android apps to the Google Play Store is suspended until Google resolves this.\n\nAndroid apps that are pending submission will stay on the \"Pending\" status for the moment.\nWe strongly suggest self-hosting the apps. These requests are the only ones that will get processed at this moment.,


## Self-host your Android apps


> **Own Google Play Developer account required**
> To host your Android app yourself, you need a Google Play Developer account. If you don't have one, you can [sign up for one here](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/signup/).\nAmazon also offers a free alternative at the [Amazon App Store](https://developer.amazon.com/public/support/submitting-your-app)
You have the possibility of hosting your Android app on your own Google Play Developer account.

On the request details page, edit the app request, then tick the "Self-hosted" checkbox.
![](https://images.shoutca.st/DA2ci8cQ5WCGDFRbaRiw_Schermafbeelding%202016-03-26%20om%2014.07.32.png)
Save the request, then wait for the app to be built by us. You'll get an email once it is ready.

Once it has been processed (you'll get an email), you'll find the link to download your APK as well as the screenshots to use for the Play Store listing on that page.
![](https://images.shoutca.st/Imu0nUSdQau3nly1XCbL_Schermafbeelding%202016-03-26%20om%2014.16.10.png)
To publish an app, simply open the [Google Play developer console](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/) (not to be confused with the browser's developer console), then click on "Add new application" and follow the steps.

## Unpublishing your app(s) from the app store(s)

This cannot be done automatically in Control. You'll have to request this by opening a ticket (mentioning your app name and your username).

## I don't have any SHOUTca.st services. Can I order a custom mobile app?

Unfortunately, this is not possible. Having a streaming service with us is mandatory for our mobile apps to work properly.

## Can I have the source code?

Our apps are not open source.
